It tells you rain forecast,max temprature,min temprature,humidity,wind speed.
It has a location button through which you can transverse to your location again.
You can add different cities to watch list as it stores on local storage.
You can check weather of a week too.
Dark mode and light mode also avilable.
Through a button you can change all tempratures to Celcius to Fahrenheit.
It is a completely responsive website.
There is also half implemented map where you can check the weather.

  ## Why I choose this project
   - As I had plans scheduled this week,I choose a project which I could complete in 5 days and learn something new.
   - Never worked with locations and weather APIs,so wanted to try something new.
   - Wanted to implement simple JS features such as dark/light mode in a project.
   - Wanted to learn local storages
   - Was boared of studying node js,so choose a project on JS where I can revise.Take a look at hackoverflow project where I implemented backend a week earlier https://github.com/abhishek-sultaniya/triquetra-hackoverflow

## Scope and Improvements
   - Will complete the map feature first,where you can see the location by maps.
   - Improving the bugs and working on light theme
   - Connecting to database.
   - All the other suggestions are welcome.
