## Introduction and explaination
This is a simple weather app which extracts your location when you open it and then you can also search for weather condition of any place.
It tells you rain forecast,max temprature,min temprature,humidity,wind speed.
It has a location button through which you can transverse to your location again.
You can add different cities to watch list as it stores on local storage.
You can check weather of a week too.
Dark mode and light mode also avilable.
Through a button you can change all tempratures to Celcius to Fahrenheit.
It is a completely responsive website.
There is also half implemented map where you can check the weather.

  ## Why I choose this project
   - As I had plans scheduled this week,I choose a project which I could complete in 5 days and learn something new.
   - Never worked with locations and weather APIs,so wanted to try something new.
   - Wanted to implement simple JS features such as dark/light mode in a project.
   - Wanted to learn local storages
   - Was boared of studying node js,so choose a project on JS where I can revise.Take a look at hackoverflow project where I implemented backend a week earlier https://github.com/abhishek-sultaniya/triquetra-hackoverflow

## Scope and Improvements
   - Will complete the map feature first,where you can see the location by maps.
   - Improving the bugs and working on light theme
   - Connecting to database.
   - All the other suggestions are welcome.
